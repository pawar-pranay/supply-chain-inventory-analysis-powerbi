## 🔧 Project Workflow

- Imported a publicly available CSV dataset contains supply chain and inventory data  
- Cleaned and transformed the data in Power Query  
- Created KPIs using DAX, including Warehouse Utilization, Inventory Turnover Ratio, and Days Sales of Inventory  
- Designed an interactive Power BI dashboard featuring gauges, donut charts, clustered bar and column charts, and line charts  
- The dashboard visualizes key metrics such as transportation costs by region and category, inventory levels, average lead time across categories, units sold over time, and backorder counts by order status.
- Added slicers for category and region to enable dynamic filtering and exploration

## 🔍 Key Insights

- **Warehouse utilization** is significantly low, averaging around **35%** across all warehouses, which is well below the recommended benchmark of **75%**, indicating underutilized storage capacity.  
- **Transportation costs** are significantly greater in the West region, indicating potential inefficiencies or longer distribution routes in that zone.  
- **Inventory levels for the Clothing category** are relatively high, which could be due to a large number of SKUs or potential overstocking.  
- The **average lead time is 15 days**, which may be acceptable depending on the industry norm, but could be improved to increase responsiveness and customer satisfaction.  
- A **sharp decline in units sold** is observed during **2020 and 2021**, likely due to the **COVID-19 pandemic** and resulting **economic recession**, affecting supply and consumer demand.
